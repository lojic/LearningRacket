# Bank Account

Bank accounts can be accessed in different ways at the same time.

A bank account can be accessed in multiple ways. Clients can make
deposits and withdrawals using the internet, mobile phones, etc. Shops
can charge against the account.

Create an account that can be accessed from multiple threads/processes
(terminology depends on your programming language).

It should be possible to close an account; operations against a closed
account must fail.

Have fun!
