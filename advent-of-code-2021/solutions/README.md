# Advent of Code 2021 Solutions
* Each day is in its own directory
* My main solution (w/o input from others) is dayNN.rkt with dayNN.txt for the input file
* There may be a minimized version in dayNN-min.rkt
* There may be a version with ideas gleaned from others in dayNN-conspicio.rkt
* If I essentially port another solution, it will be in dayNN-\<name\>.rkt
* Non-Racket versions, if any, are likely done w/ knowledge of other solutions
